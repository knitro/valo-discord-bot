# valo-discord-bot

A discord bot originally developed to learn more about python and experiment the discord.py library.

## Current Functionality

### valo_news.py

- Simple bot that generates the patch notes link of whatever the user specifies. Otherwise it returns the latest patch.
- _Note: the latest patch is currently hardcoded. Will need to integrate with Riot API or use alternative methods to retrieve this information._

### valo_lineups.py

- Discord bot to support lineup generation for **Valo Lineups**.
- Makes it easy to generate data that can be imported into **Valo Lineups** through a CSV file or by copy pasting the data straight into the WebApp in edit mode (edit mode TBD).
